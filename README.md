# Gas Giants Website
This website was my final project for my Web Design 1 class. Each person was allowed to pick their own theme/subject, but we had to meet a set of requirements, including: paragraph elements with css styling applied, an embedded YouTube video, at least two special characters, at least four hex color codes, etc.

For the project, we supposed to use hard-coded dimensions, so this website is built to fit the dimensions of my school computer, the 2017 MacBook Air. If you are using a different device, you can go into Chrome's devtools by clicking inspect and then toggle the device toolbar by pressing the second button from the top left of the devtools. From there, set the dimensions to 1440 x 789 to get the proper fit of the website. The screen size of the device toolbar is quite buggy but I have added a red border that should show where the corners of the website are supposed to be.
